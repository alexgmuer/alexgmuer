## Intro
I am a student at the University of Connecticut currently pursuing
Bachelors degrees in both Computer Engineering and Mathematics. 
My current interests include digital signal processing and 
control theory, in the context of embedded systems. I will be 
updating this personal repository with interesting projects that may 
or may not relate to these interests as I see fit.
